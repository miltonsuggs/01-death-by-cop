# USA Police Shootings 2015-2020
An exploration of fatal police shootings in the USA from 2015 to 2020

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Since its inception, police in America have continued to have a tenuous and volatile relationship with many of its citizens, especially those of lower economic status and people of color. In this notebook I will perform a exploratory data analysis on a dataset that consists of people killed by police throughout the United States from the year 2015 to 2020.

I hope this notebook provides you with insights and I hope that we can all work toward rectifying the racial and economic disparity that continues to fuel police brutality in these United States of America.
